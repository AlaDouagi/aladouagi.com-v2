### Background

In most applications that have a feature requiring data listing, we encounter
the need for a debounced search input to present data.

After writing this kind of component in the past using Angular or React, I
discovered itâ€™s one of the best scenarios to rely on Reactive programming using
RxJS.

### Starting point

For the requirements that we need to cover for a basic search functionality is
to:

- Trigger the HTTP search request whenever the trimmed input value is changed
  after `debounceTime`.
- Cancel previous request if it's still pending AND a new search value has
  arrived after it passed the `debounceTime`
- Return an empty array if an error happens without breaking the flow

### Reasoning

Considering the code to solve the above problem, we're mostly relying on the
**timing** and **content** of the **search string**. This leads to the idea of
having an Observable of a search string as the root source of our stream.

Below is the full code of the function explained with comments that generate
this stream. After having this as the base logic for the debounced search, we
will reuse it in a React hook.

```typescript
import {type Dispatch, type SetStateAction} from 'react'
import {
  type Observable,
  Subject,
  catchError,
  debounceTime,
  distinctUntilChanged,
  filter,
  map,
  merge,
  of,
  switchMap,
  takeUntil,
  tap,
} from 'rxjs'

export const DEBOUNCE_TIME = 500

export function searchObserver$<T>(
  textSubject$: Subject<string>,
  fetcher$: (text: string) => Observable<T[]>,
  {
    setIsLoading,
    setOptions,
  }: {
    setIsLoading: Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>
    setOptions: Dispatch<SetStateAction<T[]>>
  },
  debounceTimeout = DEBOUNCE_TIME,
) {
  return textSubject$.pipe(
    // Trim the search string
    map((query = '') => query?.trim()),
    // Listen only for a string that has charcters (No "  " passing)
    filter<string>(Boolean),
    // Debounce the search stream
    debounceTime(debounceTimeout),
    // Extra: Don't trigger search of you change the string and revert it quicky before debounceTimeout
    distinctUntilChanged(),
    // Trigger loading event
    tap(() => setIsLoading(true)),
    // Trigger search HTTP request
    switchMap((text) => fetcher$(text).pipe(takeUntil(textSubject$))), // Cancel previous request if it's still pending
    // Resolve loading state and set results
    tap((opts) => {
      setOptions(opts)
      setIsLoading(false)
    }),
    catchError((_error, caught) => {
      // Reset state in case of an error
      setOptions([])
      setIsLoading(false)
      // Respawn the stream after it completed running with an error
      return merge(of([] as T[]), caught)
    }),
  )
}
```

### Inegrate Reactivity using React hooks

```typescript
import {type Dispatch, type SetStateAction, useEffect, useRef} from 'react'
import {type Observable, Subject} from 'rxjs'
import {searchObserver$} from './searchObserver'

export function useSearch<T>(
  fetcher$: (text: string) => Observable<T[]>,
  componentSetters: {
    setIsLoading: Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>
    setOptions: Dispatch<SetStateAction<T[]>>
  },
  debounceTime?: number,
) {
  const textSubject$ = useRef(new Subject<string>())

  useEffect(() => {
    const watcher = searchObserver$<T>(
      textSubject$.current,
      fetcher$,
      componentSetters,
      debounceTime,
    ).subscribe()

    return () => watcher.unsubscribe()
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [])

  return (text: string) => textSubject$.current.next(text)
}
```

### HTTP Request logic to be used

Since we have HTTP request cancellation in our logic, we need to handle it.
Luckily, we have an out-of-the-box function ready to use with this flow thanks
to RxJS.

The fromFetch function is fetch API based but is adapted to Reactivity needs.
The code below is for the search fetcher that we use in our demo:

```typescript
import {fromFetch} from 'rxjs/fetch'
import {map, type Observable} from 'rxjs'
import {type Option} from '../components/autocomplete'

const URL = `https://digimoncard.io/api-public/search.php`

export function searchDigimonCards$(search: string): Observable<Option[]> {
  return fromFetch<Record<string, string>[]>(`${URL}?n=${search}`, {
    selector: (res) => res.json(),
  }).pipe(map((res) => res.map(({id, name}) => ({label: name, value: id}))))
}
```
